					<h3>Smith Rock State Park (Oregon)</h3>
					<p class = "text">The park is just outside the town of Terrebonne, in Central Oregon's High Desert near Bend. With dramatic cliffs, towering red rocks, a meandering river and views for days, Smith Rock State Park is spectacular in every season.
						As one of the natural wonders of Oregon, this pristine area in the centre of the state is well worth the trip, whether it’s for a quick stop to look out from one of the great viewpoints near the park’s entrance or to properly explore by heading down into the canyon.</p>
				</div>

			<div class = "location2">
				<h3>Cannon Beach (Oregon)</h3>
				<p class = "text">Cannon Beach is a city in Clatsop County, Oregon. The Pacific Ocean and the Coast Mountain Range cradles Cannon Beach, one of Oregon’s coastal cities known for its forested bluffs, towering monoliths and miles of pristine, sandy beaches, the latter earning it accolades as one of “Americas Best Beaches.” The dramatic Cannon Beach coastline offers an inspiring mélange of nature: sand, ocean, mountains, rock, and birds, all of which bring tourists flocking to this popular beach town, 90 minutes west of Portland. Cannon Beach is a small coastal city in northwest Oregon. It’s known for its long, sandy shore. Standing tall in the ocean, Haystack Rock is a seasonal haven for tufted puffins. On a headland to the north, trails in Ecola State Park offer sweeping views of the ocean, coves and a lighthouse. South is Arcadia Beach, with tide pools and a picnic area. Nearby Hug Point has sea caves. Boutiques and galleries dot downtown.</p>

				<div class = "about-right">
					<h3>Pike Place Express Farmers Market (Seattle)</h3>
					<p class = "text">Pike Place Market has been the cornerstone of Seattle's food scene since 1907. That makes it the oldest continuously-running public farmer's market in the United States. The market receives over 10 million visitors a year! (In comparison, the Space Needle receives 1.3 million visitors each year.) It's a landmark daily market with famed fish-throwing seafood vendors, produce stalls & other shops.</p>

					<h3>How does it feel when you live in a campervan?</h3>
					<p class = "text">Campervans are traditionally smaller than traditional RV vans, which makes them accessible for nearly anyone to drive. One of the benefits of a campervan is how easy they are to get around. Because they are built on the body of production-model vehicles, anyone who has driven a large truck or minivan can learn to get around in a campervan easily! Plus, campervans often come with a lower cost compared to a traditional RV, with many of the same features.
						On the downside, campervans come with much less space than a traditional RV. While a larger motorhome or recreational vehicle can fit an entire family, campervans are best fitted for much smaller groups—two or three people, at the most. It was my very first time staying in a camper van, and I was shocked that so many great amenities could be crammed into such a small space.
						<br>This lifestyle gives you the freedom to travel —unrestrained by societal infrastructure. Sleep beneath a sea of stars in the middle of a pitch-black desert, wake up to the sun rising above the nearby mountain peak with the sounds of a babbling brook.</p>
